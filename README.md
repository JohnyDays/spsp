Single Page Slim Prototyping
====
Usage 
==
```
cd any-dir
ssproto create
```

This will create the template project inside the folder, and start watching index.slim, the css folder, the js folder and the sass folder for any changes you make, and automatically update index.html. 

If you have already created the project, you can use 
```
ssproto watch
```
